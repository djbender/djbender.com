<blockquote>The corn city central<br/>

is where we play<br/>

corn city central<br/>

fructose all day<br/>

run that ball, plow that field<br/>

all the sugars is what we yield</blockquote>&#8212;This hymnal of corn, brought to you byÂ <a href="//chefkittie.com" target="_blank">chefkittie.com</a>.
