Marco talking about Ariel Meadow Stalling's [post][1]:

{% blockquote %}

The way to stop supporting terrible media is to stop watching or reading it.

{% endblockquote %}

The corollary: Why are you consuming terrible media?

Link-baiting articles are a blight, and the only way for change is by
people voting with their clicks. There's plenty of sites I just avoid
because the article quality is so abysmal. Fiercely and confidently vet
the sites you view. Maybe you're winding up on the same trashy 'news' and
'rumors' site that's plagued with distasteful ads and questionable
editorial ethics and morals. Next time you're tempted to click on a baiting
headline, maybe look and see where it's hosted first.

Related: I cut the cable cord years ago and haven't looked back. In fact when I
catch television at a friends house I'm more interested in the ads because
they're _so_ terrible. It's like a train wreck.
