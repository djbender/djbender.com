One thing I miss about private guitar lessons is learning small exercises
that improve your hands' dexterity and agility. John Petrucci of Dream
Theater fame has two [excellent][1] [articles][2] over at guitarworld.com
that are really solid.

His advice on practicing is spot on:

{% blockquote [John Petrucci] %}
Of all the things that can frustrate a guitarist the most, it's the nagging feeling that he's not reaching a certain level of proficiency as quickly as he should.
{% endblockquote %}

I couldn't agree more. This has been my experience with my DIY approach to
guitar playing for the last several years. It's quite easy to fall into
the trap of not pushing yourself. Exercises like these will definitely
help any player increase their level of proficiency rapidly. Just remember
to start out slow with a metronome.
