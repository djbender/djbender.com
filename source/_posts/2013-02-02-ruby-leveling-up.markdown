I've collected quite a few resources as of late to further my knowledge in
developing in [Ruby][1]. With so many excellent resources popping up it
would be helpful to point potential learners to a shortlist of some of the
best available.

[Code School][2] — $25/month
-----------

Over at [Code School][2] they're currently offering 22 [courses][3] in a
variety of topics within Ruby, JavaScript, design, and web tools. The cost
is $25/month but if you're ambitious it's feasible to complete them all in
a month. Code School offers several free courses and will reward you with
a $5 offer code upon completion. Free courses include [Try Git][4],
[jQuery Air: First Flight][5], [Try Ruby][6], [Rails for Zombies
Redux][7], and [Try R][8].



For completionists, I recommend starting with the courses you're most
experienced with first.

[Rails Tutorial][9] — $26
--------------




[Ruby Science][10]— $49
------------

[Destroy All Software][11] — $9/month
--------------------

[Railscasts][12] — $9/month
