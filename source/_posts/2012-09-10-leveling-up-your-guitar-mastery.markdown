I *love* my guitar. I've been practicing for about 10 years now and I've
certainly gone through phases of excitement towards practicing. Early on I
took lessons from an excellent instructor but I didn't take my scales and
theory lessons too seriously. I'd learn the random rock song but never
made it past the chord progressions. Solos and more advanced guitar
techniques eluded me. I had the naive frame of mind that one day it would
just click and I would be a guitar master. This couldn't be further from
the truth! 

Improving your mastery of guitar performance takes dedication and some
serious practicing. Noodling around on your guitar for two hours once
every other week will not net any real advancement even though it may be
entertaining.  My own motivation for practicing was rather rudimentary
throughout the first ten years of practice. I would sit down and practice
major scales (minor? what's that?) and then within ten minutes I'd be off
playing some lick or song that I had probably learned five years earlier.
Not exactly the path of real guitar mastery.  In fact, my motivation for
any sort of true guitar mastery was never really there until I was truly
inspired.

When I first gave Dream Theater's newest album "A Dramatic Turn of Events"
a listen, something in me stirred. You might guess that it was the
epic nature of Dream Theater's lead guitarist John Petrucci's virtuoso
guitar performance that inspired me to new heights. This wasn't the case
because I've always had a fascination with talented performers regardless
of instrumentation. The real reason John Petrucci inspires me even today
is because of his extreme dedication to his craft. Like a master
blacksmith of years past, John Petrucci has cultivated a level of guitar
mastery than most will only dream about. It is his shear level of respect
for his craft and obscene amount of time spent mastering that craft by
which I am awstruck. That's when my practicing changed.

I stumbled across John Petrucci's instructional DVD "Rock Discipline" and
was quickly hooked. The exercises are simple to pick up but take an
eternity to master. 

The biggest thing you can do is set goals for yourself. Decide what it is
about your guitar playing you want to improve and write it down. Maybe you
want to learn a specific guitar solo. Practice it with at a slow enough
speed for your abilities. Slower is never too slow.
