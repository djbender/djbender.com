I'm not sure I like the idea of giving all my data to tumblr. Don't get
me wrong they're a great service providing a real solution to easily
posting content to a blog. Instead, the idea of an open web that
individuals control sounds much more appealing.

Is it more work? Yes. Yes it is. If you're interested in the tech side
I've moved to the [Octopress][1] suites of tools which uses [Jekyll][2]
to generate a static site from markdown files in a git repo. The blog is
running on [Heroku][3] (free!) and since all the content lives in
markdown files, there's no database required. And that's part of the
secret of this system: static html is as fast as it gets. In a way,
Ocotopress (but more specifically Jekyll) lets me have my dynamic code
cake and eat it too!

I'm hoping the new domain name (a .com!) and blogging system will allow
me to get some more writing done. I don't have any financial incentive to
write but I believe that writing helps me develop my ideas in the rest
of my life and work so there is definite intangible value to the process.
We'll see if that comes to pass, I've certainly said similar things in
the past.

The one downside to this system is that it *really* gives me a lot of
fiddle-y knobs to play with since it is a fully custom system. There will
be some modifications coming to the styles, as it's a little too muted
for my tastes right now.

Stay tuned, lots of topics incoming.
